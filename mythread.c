/*Just as every process has a process ID, every thread has a thread ID. Unlike the process ID, which is unique in the system, 
  the thread ID has significance only within the context of the process to which it belongs.
A thread ID is represented by the pthread_t data type. Implementations are allowed to use a structure to represent the pthread_t data type,
so portable implementations canâ€™t treat them as integers.
Linux 3.2.0 uses an unsigned long integer for the pthread_t data type. Solaris 10 represents the pthread_t data type as an unsigned integer. FreeBSD 8.0 and Mac OS X 10.6.8 use a pointer to the pthread structure for the pthread_t data type.
Hence in our case  data type of pthread_t is unsigned long int

       creation  time  to determine attributes for the new thread; this structure is initialized
       using pthread_attr_init(3) and related functions.  If attr is NULL, then  the  thread  is
